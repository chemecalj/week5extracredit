Dice game displaying the sleep/time and random/randint modules

I created this game for another python class I took before. 
It shows the sleep module manipulating the dice to give the appearance of rolling dice.

The sleep and the random module must be imported because neither module is part of the 
base python functions. The time and randint aspect get called from the modules themselves.

To import the sleep module you must use the code "from time import sleep". This will allow you to 
import the time module and more specifically the sleep aspect of that module.

To use the randint from the random module you must use the code "from random import randint". Just like 
the sleep module you must import the random module then call the randint aspect of the module.
